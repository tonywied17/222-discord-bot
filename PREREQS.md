## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation and setup of the 222 Discord Bot, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

### 1. Node.js and npm

- **Node.js:** The runtime environment required to run the bot. The bot is built on Node.js, hence it is essential.
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes bundled with Node.js and is used for managing dependencies.

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If these commands do not return version numbers, you need to install Node.js. Visit [Node.js's official website](https://nodejs.org/) for download and installation instructions.

### 2. Git

- **Git:** A version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. It's required to clone the bot project from GitHub.

To check if you have Git installed, run:

```bash
git --version
```

If this command does not return a version number, you will need to install Git. Visit [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/) for download and installation instructions.

### 3. A Discord Account

- **Discord Account:** Necessary to create a Discord bot and obtain the required credentials like the Bot Token and Client ID.

Ensure you're logged into [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create and manage your bot applications.

### 4. A Code Editor (Optional)

- **Code Editor:** While not strictly required, a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text will make editing and managing your bot's code much easier.

These prerequisites are essential for the successful setup and operation of the 222 Discord Bot on your server. Once you have these ready, you can proceed with the bot's installation and setup instructions as provided.
